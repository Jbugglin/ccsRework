    -Address should be clickable to map directions...

Client Testimonials:
“We act as partners.”

"With the volume of service requests I see on a daily basis, I appreciate the way CCSPS communicates. Intense large projects are brought into the limelight. The small routine projects go unnoticed and are just completed. All projects are completed the first time. I haven’t experienced a call back yet.”
– Director of Facilities, Leading Restaurant Group

"Rick and his crew have always gone above and beyond to make sure our expectations are met. There's been many times where I've needed a plumbing repair done right away and I have yet to be let down. From small jobs to large scale projects, we have made CCS plumbing our go to company after using the same big-name company for years."
- Director of Facilities, Local Restaurant Group

"I've been in this industry for a while and it's tough to find a company that truly cares and understands our needs as a property management company. With CCS it's more than just the great work they do, it's the relationships that have been built."
