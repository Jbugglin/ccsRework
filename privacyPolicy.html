CCS Mechanical Services (LLC) is committed to respecting your online privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information you share with us.

Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit CCS Mechanical Services’ web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.

If you choose to provide us with your personal information on the Web, we may transfer that information within CCS Mechanical Services or to CCS Mechanical Services’ third-party service providers, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.

CCS Mechanical Services strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, CCS Mechanical Services intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Online Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your personal information from your country to countries that may not require an “adequate” level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.

Tracking Technologies

Our Web pages may utilize popular tracking technologies. Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; click patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. Our use of tracking technologies allows us to improve our Web site and your Web experience. We may also analyze information that does not contain personal information for trends and statistics.

To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:

Choice
Security
Access/Accuracy
Choice
You may choose whether or not to provide personal information to CCS Mechanical Services. The notice we intend to provide where CCS Mechanical Services collects personal information on the Web should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the personal information we request, you can still visit most of CCS Mechanical Services’ web pages, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.

If you choose to have a relationship with CCS Mechanical Services, such as a contractual or other business relationship or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.

Security
Wherever your personal information may be held within CCS Mechanical Services or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the personal information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure.

Access/Accuracy
To the extent that you do provide us with personal information, CCS Mechanical Services wishes to maintain accurate personal information. Where we collect personal information from you on the Web, our goal is to provide a means of contacting CCS Mechanical Services should you need to update or correct that information. If for any reason those means are unavailable or inaccessible, you may send updates and corrections about your personal information to our mailing address and we will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your personal information that we hold as soon as practicable.

Third Party Services
CCS Mechanical Services does not intend to transfer personal information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on CCS Mechanical Services’ behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is against CCS Mechanical Services’ policy to sell personal information collected online without consent.

Commitment
We are committed to privacy support current industry initiatives to preserve individual privacy rights on the Internet. Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and CCS Mechanical Services’ Web pages are constantly evolving to meet these demands.

Your Consent
By using this Web site, you consent to the terms of our Online Privacy Policy and to CCS Mechanical Services processing of personal information for the purposes given above as well as those explained where CCS Mechanical Services collects personal information on the Web. Should the Online Privacy Policy change, we intend to take every reasonable step to ensure that these changes are brought to your attention by posting all changes prominently on our web site for a reasonable period of time.
