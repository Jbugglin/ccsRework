                "With the volume of service requests I see on a daily basis, I appreciate the way CCSPS communicates. Intense large projects are brought into the limelight. The small routine projects go unnoticed and are just completed. All projects are completed the first time. I haven’t experienced a call back yet.”

                "Rick and his crew have always gone above and beyond to make sure our expectations are met. There's been many times where I've needed a plumbing repair done right away and I have yet to be let down. From small jobs to large scale projects, we have made CCS plumbing our go to company after using the same big-name company for years."
